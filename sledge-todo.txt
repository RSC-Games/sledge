implement constant literals in cst generator (ensure names don't start with a number and literals are numeric only)
add <=, >=, <, >, ==, !=, &&, ||, !
add proper command line switch support, and add --verbose, -v; --hammer, -c; --help, -h; etc
TODO: print a help message to show the above command line switches and usage.
add a help message.

add a system for building other sledge projects as dependencies
allow manual specification of required libs and mark them as buildable dependencies (if necessary)
add support for external modules on PATH (TODO: not specified below)
allow exclusion of resources from various locations in the final JAR
allow marking of files to compile, or autogenerate them if requested (ignore all folders with a ./hammer in them)

List of sledge variables:
PLATFORM (str) [windows | macos | linux]:
	Contains the OS sledge is currently running on. Can be changed with -DPLATFORM=<os>
	if cross-compiling for another platform (necessary for certain Java projects).

ARCH (str) [x64 | aarch64]:
	Host processor architecture. Not strictly necessary for Java unless JNI libraries
	are in use.

SLEDGE_VERSION (literal) [4+]:
	Sledge version currently in use. None of the below commands were supported prior.

SLEDGE_MAJOR (literal) [0+]:
	Active sledge major number. Major versions introduce new commands and can change
	older ones (not frequent), since backward compatibility should be maintained
	between major versions.

SLEDGE_MINOR (literal) [0+]:
	Active sledge minor number. Minor versions introduce small features here and there,
	and will always be backward compatible across versions.

SLEDGE_DEBUG (str) [not defined]: (need to make a separate switch)
	Enables verbose message output from sledge for development purposes. Useful both for
	developing sledge and for writing the sledge script, though it's less useful now that
	the parser can competently report errors.	

COMPILER_FLAGS (str) []:
	Flags passed to javac or other compilers when compiling the source code.

List of sledge units:
%settoolchain [javac path=javac, jar path=jar, min java version=17]:
	Sets the toolchain locations, paths, and variables used by sledge. Required for
	building any project properly. If this unit isn't executed, default values are
	used.

%depresolve_mode [mode: auto | manual] (default: auto)
	Determines how sledge locates and registers dependencies (like external JARs)
	Auto informs sledge to walk the project directory and add all JAR files found
	during the walk to the project dependency tree. Manual requires all dependencies
	to be manually registered by the dev. Only usable in __init.
	
%dep_exclude [folder/file path, ...]
	Note: For use with the auto resolver. 
	Informs sledge to skip the listed directories or files (if more than one is 
	provided) and not to register any JARs found within/not register the specific JAR
	(if specified). There is no limit on the amount of folders/libs you can exclude.

%dep_exclude_sources [suffix, ...]
	Note: For use with the auto resolver.
	Skip all JARs with the provided suffixes immediately preceeding the file extension.
	Useful for removing annotated source JARs that are not necessary for a build.

%registerdep [folder/file path, ...]
	Note: For use with the manual resolver.
	Informs sledge to register the provided file as a dependency, or (if a folder is
	provided), register all JARs within recursively. Can be paired with %dep_exclude.

%projectname [project name]
	Set the project's name. Should look something like this, and should be in quotes:
		> project_name 

%entrypoint [path to main class]
	Specifies the location of the main class. Especially useful if the main class is
	in a non-standard location.

%targetdir [folder path]
	Specifies the directory to perform the next operation in. Must be a path relative
	to <PROJECT ROOT>/build. All following operations will be done in this folder.

%clean [target folder path]
	Removes all target folders and all build artifacts. If a target folder path is
	specified, that is removed instead.

%saveartifact [file path]
	Specifies a file relative to the target directory to copy into the build folder
	for a different build stage.

%restoreartifact [file path, keep=true]
	Copies an artifact from the build folder into the target directory at a given path.
	If keep is specified and false then the file is moved instead.

NOTE: Should be a conditional that is recognized by the parser (reserved word)
%artifactexists [file path]
	Determine if an artifact is present. Useful for skipping build jobs that don't need
	to be redone.

NOTE: See above
%targetbuilt [file path]
	Identify if the particular target folder has a fully built object. Also determine if
	a rebuild is necessary due to newer timestamps.

%compile [filter=".java", ...]
%javac [filter=".java", ...]
	Compile source files and emit the object code in the target folder.

%javac_lib [filter=".java", ...]
	Compile source files and emit the object code in the target folder. Differs from the
	above in that it compiles every file in the folder, rather than just the entry point.

%mkjar [manifest]
	Generate a JAR archive with the emitted source code/resources from the target folder.
	If no manifest is specified, this unit will generate its own and use that. Implicitly
	copies the JAR to the build folder after execution as code.jar.

%mkromjar [jarname]
	Generate a JAR archive with all files found within the target folder. If no name is
	specified, it will generate a JAR named res.jar and copy that to the build folder.

%mkdist [jar path, ...]
	If no dist folder exists, this unit will create a folder named "dist", copy code.jar
	(and rom.jar if it exists), and all registered dependencies to the dist folder.
	Dependencies will be located in the dist folder at ./lib, regardless of where they
	are in the project root. If jar paths are specified, those JARs and their dependencies
	will be copied into the dist folder instead of code.jar and rom.jar.

	This is the final step of the build process in most cases.

%cpresources [folder path, ...]
	Copy the resources in the source directory in each argument provided to the current 
	target folder at the same relative path.

%builddep_sledge [folder dep_root, ...]
	Recursively call sledge on a submodule and run its own build process before continuing
	this one.

%log [message, ...]
	Print a message. Probably needed every now and then.

%warn [message, ...]
	Print a warning. Probably more important.

%error [message, ...]
	Something was encountered that should not be the case. Abort.
